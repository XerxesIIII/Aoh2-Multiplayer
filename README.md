# Introduction

i was tryna make a launcher like anydesk, parsec, remote desktop connection with python (FFmpeg) to stream and capture outputs from the host.py aoh2 to the client.py but i failed horribly at maintaining performance and didnt even get to capturing keyboard&mouse inputs hope someone will continue this project üôè

# How to use 

open a aoh2 tab that's name is exactly Age of Civilizations II (or config the source code) then run the client WHILE THE AOH2 IS SELECTED then you'll have a aoh2 on the background displaying the aoh2 your playing yayyyy (you cannot play on anothor pc you can change the ip sure but i havent tried it out as i said this thing is left unfinished)

# Things to do 
-reduce the lag
-add input for the client
- yeah thats it
